<p align="center">This is a rest api manipulation project built on Node js and Express using Typescript</p>


### Assumption Made

- As it has been mentioned at the question to return only the endpont with the updated Employee list along with added country specific information, I have used to obtain the empployee list from the statically declared json object.
- There is no specific api mentioned to return the updated list , hence assumed to just return the list.
